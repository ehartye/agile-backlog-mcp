# Example Slash Commands for Agile MCP Workflows

## Overview

These are example slash commands you can add to your Claude Code configuration (`.claude/commands/`) to streamline common agile workflows.

---

## Developer Slash Commands

### `/start-feature` - Begin work on a new feature

**File:** `.claude/commands/start-feature.md`

```markdown
You are starting work on a new feature. Follow this workflow:

1. Ask the user for:
   - Feature name/description
   - Project identifier (or list available projects)
   - Priority (high/medium/low)
   - Estimated story points (if known)

2. Create the story using the Agile MCP:
   - Tool: create_story
   - Include: title, description, priority, acceptance criteria

3. Ask the user to break down implementation steps

4. Create tasks for each step:
   - Tool: create_task (for each implementation task)

5. Mark the first task as "in_progress"

6. Provide a summary showing:
   - Story created (with ID)
   - Tasks created (with IDs)
   - What you'll work on first

Then proceed to implement the first task.

**Output format:**
```
‚úì Created Story #123: [Feature Name]
  - Priority: [X]
  - Estimated: [Y] points

‚úì Created Tasks:
  1. Task #1: [name] (in_progress)
  2. Task #2: [name]
  3. Task #3: [name]

Starting implementation of Task #1...
```
```

---

### `/complete-task` - Mark current task done and move to next

**File:** `.claude/commands/complete-task.md`

```markdown
You are completing the current task and moving to the next one.

1. Ask which task was just completed (or infer from context)

2. Update the task to "done":
   - Tool: update_task
   - status: "done"

3. Ask if there are any technical notes to add:
   - If yes: create_note with markdown content
   - If no: continue

4. Check for remaining tasks:
   - Tool: list_tasks(story_id: X, status: "todo")

5. If tasks remain:
   - Mark next task as "in_progress"
   - Summarize what's next

6. If no tasks remain:
   - Ask if story is complete
   - If yes: update_story(status: "done")
   - Celebrate completion!

**Output format:**
```
‚úì Task #45 marked as done
‚úì Added technical note

Next up: Task #46 - [task name]
[Brief description of what this task involves]

Ready to proceed?
```
```

---

### `/add-tech-note` - Document technical decision

**File:** `.claude/commands/add-tech-note.md`

```markdown
You are documenting a technical decision or discovery.

1. Ask the user:
   - What entity type (story/task)
   - Entity ID (or infer from current work)
   - What to document

2. Create a well-formatted markdown note:
   - Tool: create_note
   - parent_type: "story" or "task"
   - parent_id: <ID>
   - content: Use markdown formatting

3. Structure the note with:
   - ## Heading for the topic
   - **Decision:** What was decided
   - **Rationale:** Why this choice
   - **Alternatives considered:** What else was evaluated
   - **Impact:** How this affects the code

**Example note format:**
```markdown
## Authentication Library Choice

**Decision:** Using `jsonwebtoken` v9.0.0 for JWT handling

**Rationale:**
- Industry standard with 25k+ stars
- Active maintenance and security updates
- Simple API matching our needs

**Alternatives considered:**
- jose: More modern but smaller community
- passport-jwt: Too heavyweight for our use case

**Impact:**
- Added dependency (23kb gzipped)
- Standardized auth across all services
```
```

### `/check-blockers` - Identify and report blockers

**File:** `.claude/commands/check-blockers.md`

```markdown
You are checking for blocked work in the current project.

1. Get project identifier from context or ask user

2. Check for blocked stories:
   - Tool: list_stories(status: "blocked")

3. Check for blocked tasks:
   - Tool: list_tasks(status: "blocked")

4. For each blocked item:
   - Get details: get_story() or get_task()
   - Check notes for blocker description
   - Check dependencies: list_dependencies()

5. Generate a blocker report:

**Output format:**
```
## Blocker Report

### Blocked Stories (2)

**Story #123: User Authentication**
- Blocked by: Story #120 (Database Migration)
- Status: Database schema not finalized
- Impact: Cannot implement user table

**Story #145: Payment Integration**
- Blocked by: External API access
- Status: Waiting for vendor API keys
- Impact: Cannot test payment flow

### Blocked Tasks (1)

**Task #67: Deploy to staging**
- Blocked by: CI/CD pipeline setup
- Parent Story: #123

### Recommendations
1. Prioritize Story #120 to unblock authentication
2. Follow up with vendor for API keys
3. Assign DevOps resource to CI/CD setup
```
```

## Backlog Health Report

### Overall Health: üü° Yellow (68%)

### Metrics
- **Total Stories:** 45

   - Define acceptance criteria for high-priority work

2. **Backlog Grooming:**
   - Create epics for orphaned stories
   - Archive low-priority stories older than 6 months

3. **Target Health:** üü¢ Green (>85%)
   - Requires: Estimating 12 stories + criteria for 8 stories

**Schedule backlog grooming session?**
```

    ‚Üì blocks
Story #123: User Authentication (5 pts)
    ‚Üì blocks
Story #125: User Profile (5 pts)
    ‚Üì blocks
Story #130: Settings Page (2 pts)
```

### Parallel Work (can start immediately)

## Installation Instructions

To use these slash commands:

1. Create `.claude/commands/` directory in your project
2. Create individual `.md` files for each command
3. Copy the command content (without the outer markdown code fence)
4. Use in Claude Code with `/command-name`

Example:
```bash
mkdir -p .claude/commands
cat > .claude/commands/start-feature.md << 'EOF'
You are starting work on a new feature. Follow this workflow:
...
EOF
```

---

## Customization

You can customize these commands by:
- Changing output format
- Adding project-specific defaults
- Combining multiple commands
- Adding team-specific workflows

---

## Command Chaining

You can chain commands for common workflows:

```markdown
# Example: Full feature implementation workflow

User: "Let's build user authentication"

Claude:
1. /start-feature (creates story + tasks)
2. [Implements code]
3. /add-tech-note (documents decisions)
4. /complete-task (marks tasks done)
5. [Repeat for each task]
6. Story automatically marked done when all tasks complete
```

---

## Summary

These slash commands make agile workflows **effortless**:
- **Developers:** `/start-feature`, `/complete-task`, `/add-tech-note`
- **PM:** `/plan-sprint`, `/daily-standup`, `/sprint-retro`, `/backlog-health`
- **Utilities:** `/export-docs`, `/show-dependencies`

Copy, customize, and use them to streamline your agile process!

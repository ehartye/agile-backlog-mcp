## Core Responsibilities

### 1. Sprint Planning

**Goal:** Organize work into achievable sprints based on capacity and priorities

**Workflow:**

```markdown
## Sprint Planning Process

1. **Review Backlog**
   - list_stories(project_identifier, status: "todo", agent_identifier)
   - Review priorities and story points
   - Check for missing acceptance criteria

2. **Check Team Velocity**
   - get_velocity_report(project_identifier)
   - Calculate average velocity from last 3 sprints
   - Determine realistic capacity for upcoming sprint

3. **Create Sprint**
   - create_sprint(
       project_identifier,
       name: "Sprint X",
       goal: "<sprint objective>",
       start_date: "YYYY-MM-DD",
       end_date: "YYYY-MM-DD",
       capacity_points: <based on velocity>
     )

4. **Select Stories**
   - Prioritize by: business value, dependencies, risk
   - add_story_to_sprint(sprint_id, story_id) for each selected story
   - Monitor capacity utilization

5. **Verify Dependencies**
   - list_dependencies() to check for blockers
   - Ensure no story depends on incomplete work outside sprint
   - Reorder if needed

6. **Start Sprint**
   - start_sprint(sprint_id)
   - Creates initial burndown snapshot
```

---

### 2. Backlog Grooming

**Goal:** Keep backlog organized, prioritized, and ready for planning

**Weekly Backlog Review:**

```markdown
1. **Identify Unestimated Stories**
   - list_stories() and filter for missing points
   - Request team input on estimation
   - update_story() to add points

2. **Check for Orphaned Stories**
   - list_stories() and identify stories without epic
   - Create epics for themes: create_epic()
   - Group related stories under epics

3. **Reprioritize Based on Changes**
   - Review business priorities
   - update_story(priority: "high/medium/low/critical")
   - Ensure top N stories are sprint-ready

4. **Refine Acceptance Criteria**
   - Get stories missing criteria: get_story()
   - update_story(acceptance_criteria: "...")
   - Add notes for technical context

5. **Manage Dependencies**
   - list_dependencies()
   - Identify circular dependencies
   - Reorder backlog to resolve dependency chains
```

---

### 3. Sprint Monitoring

**Goal:** Track progress and identify issues early

**Daily Standup Support:**

```markdown
1. **Generate Burndown Chart**
   - get_sprint_burndown(sprint_id)
   - Compare actual vs. ideal burndown
   - Flag if team is behind pace

2. **Identify Blockers**
   - list_stories(status: "blocked")
   - list_tasks(status: "blocked")
   - Create notes with resolution plan

3. **Check Story Progress**
   - get_sprint(sprint_id) - shows all stories and their status
   - Calculate completion %
   - Predict sprint outcome

4. **Update Capacity**
   - If team composition changes, update_sprint(capacity_points)

5. **Manual Snapshot (if needed)**
   - create_daily_snapshot(sprint_id)
   - Useful if tracking mid-day changes
```

---

### 4. Sprint Completion

**Goal:** Close sprint and generate insights

**Sprint Review & Retrospective:**

```markdown
1. **Complete Sprint**
   - complete_sprint(sprint_id)
   - Generates final report with:
     - Completed vs. planned points
     - Completion rate
     - Remaining work

2. **Review Velocity**
   - get_velocity_report()
   - Compare to previous sprints
   - Identify trends (improving/declining)

3. **Document Retrospective**
   - create_note(
       parent_type: "sprint",
       parent_id: sprint_id,
       content: "# Retrospective Notes\n\n**What went well:**\n...\n\n**What to improve:**\n..."
     )

4. **Handle Incomplete Work**
   - list_stories(sprint_id, status: "in_progress")
   - Decide: carry over to next sprint or return to backlog
   - remove_story_from_sprint() if not carrying over

5. **Plan Next Sprint**
   - Use velocity data to set next sprint capacity
   - Repeat sprint planning process
```

## Agent Prompts & Commands

### Prompt: Sprint Planning

```markdown
# System Prompt for Sprint Planning

You are conducting a sprint planning session.

**Context:**
- Project: {{project_identifier}}
- Team velocity: {{average_velocity}} points/sprint
- Sprint duration: {{sprint_days}} days
- Sprint goal: {{goal}}

**Your tasks:**
1. Review backlog using list_stories(status: "todo", priority: "high")
2. Calculate capacity based on velocity report
3. Create sprint with appropriate capacity
4. Select stories that:
   - Align with sprint goal
   - Have clear acceptance criteria
   - Fit within capacity (don't overcommit)
   - Have no external dependencies
5. Add stories to sprint until ~80% capacity (buffer for unknowns)
6. Verify no circular dependencies
7. Start the sprint

**Output:**
- Sprint summary showing selected stories
- Total points committed
- Capacity utilization %
- Any risks or dependencies noted
```

### Prompt: Daily Standup Report

```markdown
# System Prompt for Daily Standup

Generate a daily standup report for the active sprint.

**Context:**
- Project: {{project_identifier}}
- Sprint: {{sprint_id}}

**Your tasks:**
1. Get sprint burndown: get_sprint_burndown()
2. List blocked work: list_stories(status: "blocked") + list_tasks(status: "blocked")
3. Calculate progress: (completed points / total points)
4. Check if on track: compare actual vs. ideal burndown

**Output format:**
```
## Daily Standup - {{date}}

### Progress
- **Completed:** X points
- **Remaining:** Y points
- **On track:** Yes/No (based on burndown)

## Advanced PM Workflows

### Dependency Chain Analysis

```markdown
# Goal: Identify and visualize work that must happen in sequence

1. Get all dependencies
   - list_dependencies()

2. Build dependency graph
   - For each story, check what blocks it
   - Create ordered list of work

3. Identify critical path
   - Longest chain of dependencies
   - Highlight to team as priority

4. Flag risks
   - Stories with many dependencies = high risk
   - Create notes on risk mitigation

Example output:
```
## Dependency Chain

**Critical Path:** (15 days)
Auth Story → Profile Story → Settings Story → Dashboard

**Parallel Work:**
- Email Service (independent)
- UI Components (independent)
- Documentation (independent)

**Recommendation:** Prioritize critical path work first.
```
```

### Capacity Planning for Multiple Teams

```markdown
# For organizations with multiple teams/projects

1. Get velocity for each project
   - get_velocity_report(project_identifier: "team-a")
   - get_velocity_report(project_identifier: "team-b")

2. Compare team performance
   - Identify high/low performing teams
   - Flag for coaching or process improvement

3. Balance workload
   - Check sprint capacity utilization
   - Recommend moving work between teams if needed

4. Create cross-team dependency report
   - Use list_relationships() for cross-project deps
   - Flag coordination needs
```

### Risk Management

```markdown
# Proactively identify and track project risks

1. **Technical Risk Stories**
   - Tag stories with high complexity
   - create_note() with risk assessment
   - Add extra capacity buffer

2. **Dependency Risks**
   - Stories blocked by external teams
   - Track with add_dependency() to external placeholder stories
   - Monitor in daily reports

3. **Capacity Risks**
   - Team members on vacation
   - Update sprint capacity accordingly
   - Communicate reduced commitment

4. **Scope Creep**
   - Monitor mid-sprint story additions
   - Flag if sprint capacity exceeded
   - Recommend deferring to next sprint
```

## Example Agent Interaction

```markdown
User: "Plan the next sprint for the frontend team"

PM Agent Response:

"I'll plan Sprint 23 for the frontend-app project. Let me start by analyzing the backlog and team velocity.

[Calls get_velocity_report()]

Your team's velocity over the last 3 sprints:
- Sprint 20: 42 points
- Sprint 21: 38 points
- Sprint 22: 45 points
- **Average: 41.7 points**

[Calls list_stories(status: "todo", priority: "high")]

High priority stories ready for sprint:
1. User Profile Dashboard (13 points)
2. Dark Mode Support (8 points)
3. Notification Center (13 points)
4. Performance Optimization (8 points)
5. Mobile Responsive Layout (21 points)

[Calls list_dependencies()]

Dependency check:
- ✅ No blocking dependencies found for top stories

**Recommended Sprint Plan:**

I propose a 2-week sprint (Jan 15 - Jan 29) with:
- **Capacity:** 40 points (96% of average velocity)
- **Sprint Goal:** Enhance user experience with profile dashboard and dark mode

**Stories to include:**
- User Profile Dashboard (13 pts)
- Dark Mode Support (8 pts)
- Notification Center (13 pts)
- Performance Optimization (8 pts)
- **Total:** 42 points

Mobile Responsive Layout (21 pts) is too large to fit. Recommend breaking it down or deferring.

Shall I create this sprint and add these stories?"

[Waits for user confirmation, then executes sprint creation]
```

## Integration with Developer Workflow

The PM Agent and Developer workflow work together:

| PM Agent | Developer Agent |
|----------|----------------|
| Creates epics and high-level stories | Breaks stories into tasks |
| Plans sprints | Updates task status during coding |
| Monitors burndown | Adds technical notes to tasks |
| Manages priorities | Identifies dependencies while building |
| Generates reports | Completes stories |

**Handoff pattern:**
1. PM creates story with acceptance criteria
2. Developer picks up story, creates tasks
3. Developer updates status as work progresses
4. PM monitors progress via burndown/sprint reports
5. Developer marks story done
6. PM reviews completion and updates metrics

---

## Summary

The Project Manager Agent handles **strategic coordination**:
- Sprint planning based on data (velocity, capacity)
- Backlog health and prioritization
- Dependency management and risk tracking
- Progress monitoring and reporting

This allows the development team to **focus on building** while the PM Agent ensures work is organized, tracked, and delivered predictably.

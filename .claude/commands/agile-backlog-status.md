You are checking the status of the Agile MCP backlog for the current project.

**Your workflow:**

1. Ask for the project identifier (or use "agile-backlog-mcp" for this project)

2. Use these MCP tools to gather status:
   - `list_stories` - Get all stories with their status
   - `list_epics` - Get epic organization
   - `list_sprints` - Check for active sprints (if any)

3. Generate a concise status report:

```
## Agile Backlog Status

**Stories by Status:**
- Todo: X stories
- In Progress: X stories
- Done: X stories
- Blocked: X stories

**Organization:**
- Epics: X
- Orphaned stories: X

**Active Sprint:** [Sprint name] or "No active sprint"

**Next Actions:**
[Suggest what to work on next based on priorities and blockers]
```

Be brief and actionable. Focus on what matters right now.

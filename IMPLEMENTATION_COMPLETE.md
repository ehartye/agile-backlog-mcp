## Features Summary

### Project Isolation
- Path-based security with repository tracking
- Working directory validation on every MCP tool call
- Hard errors for cross-project access attempts
- Security audit logs for all violations
- Conflict detection via `last_modified_by` tracking

### CRUD Operations
**MCP (AI Agents)**:
- All operations require `working_directory`
- All operations filtered by current project
- Create, read, update, delete for epics, stories, tasks
- Project management: register, list, get

**Web UI (Humans)**:
- Full create/edit/delete via modal forms
- Project selector to switch between projects
- All views auto-filter by selected project
- Inline project creation

### Visualization
- Backlog List: Filterable table with CRUD actions
- Dependency Graph: Interactive DAG (React Flow)
- Hierarchy Tree: D3 tree visualization
- All views project-scoped

## Testing Checklist

To verify the implementation works:

### MCP Server
1. ✅ Build completes without errors
2. Register a project via `register_project` tool
3. Create epic/story/task via MCP tools
4. Verify `working_directory` validation
5. Test cross-project access (should fail with error)
6. Check security logs via `get_security_logs`

### Web UI
1. ✅ Build completes without errors
2. Start web UI: `cd web-ui && npm run dev`
3. Select/create project in sidebar
4. Click "New Epic" and create an epic
5. Click "New Story" and create a story
6. Click edit icon to modify a story
7. Click delete icon to remove a story
8. Switch to Dependency Graph view
9. Switch to Hierarchy Tree view
10. Verify all views show only selected project's data
